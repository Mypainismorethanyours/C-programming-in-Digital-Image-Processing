# C-programming-in-Digital-Image-Processing

There are 10 labs(projects). Some just has .cpp and .h. Some includes the whole projects.

Each project has a report. You can see the algorithms and results in the report.

The format of image is .pgm. You can use Fiji.app to open it, which is stored in a compressed package. This app can also convert the format of image.

You can find average filter, median filter, image reduction, image enlargement, negative image operation, image translation, image rotation, shear opreation, Laplacian operator, Sobel operator Gamma correction, global enhancement, local enhancement, DFT, phase angle, magnitude, FFT, IDLPF, BLPF, GLPF, IHPF, BHPF, GHPF, Thresholding, Homomorphic filter, Sinusoidal noise, Bandreject filter, Alpha-trimmed mean filter, adaptive median filter, Roberts operator, Prewitt operator, canny edge detection LoG operator, global thresholding, erosion, dialation, opening operation, closing operation, boundary extracting, white connected component counting, Particles 
seprdating, Otsu, moving average thresholding, region growing.

All the images used in the programming are stored in Image. Some projects already have this file.

You may need to modify the file path in the code.
